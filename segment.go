	// Calculate segment offset in the cell, measured from the cell's centre
	// We start off assuming that the segment is starting from the top of the cell - i.e. s.inEdge being DIRECTION_UP,
	// corresponding to zero. The primary and secondary axes, as described under "SEGMENT MOVEMENT" above, are Y and X.
	// We then apply a calculation to rotate these X and Y offsets, based on the actual direction the segment is coming from.
	// Let's take as an example the case where the segment is moving in a straight line from top to bottom.
	// We calculate offsetX by multiplying SECONDARY_AXIS_POSITIONS[phase] by 2-turn_idx. In this case, turn_idx
	// will be 2.  So 2 - turn_idx will be zero. Multiplying anything by zero gives zero, so we end up with no
	// movement on the X axis - which is what we want in this case.
	// The starting point for the offset_y calculation is that the segment starts at an offset of -16 and must cover
	// 32 pixels over the 16 phases - therefore we must multiply phase by 2. We then subtract the result of the
	// previous line, in which stolen_y_movement was calculated by multiplying SECONDARY_AXIS_POSITIONS[phase] by
	// turn_idx % 2.  mod 2 gives either zero (if turn_idx is 0 or 2), or 1 if it's 1 or 3. In the case we're looking
	// at, turn_idx is 2, so stolen_y_movement is zero.
	// The end result of all this is that in the case where the segment is moving in a straight line through a cell,
	// it just moves at 2 pixels per frame along the primary axis. If it's turning, it starts out moving at 2px
	// per frame on the primary axis, but then starts moving along the secondary axis based on the values in
	// SECONDARY_AXIS_POSITIONS. In this case we don't want it to continue moving along the primary axis - it should
	// initially slow to moving at 1px per phase, and then stop moving completely. Effectively, the secondary axis
	// is stealing movement from the primary axis - hence the name 'stolen_y_movement'
	offsetX := SecondaryAxisPositions[phase] * (2 - int(turnIdx))

	// A rotation matrix is a set of numbers which, when multiplied by a set of coordinates, result in those
	// coordinates being rotated. Recall that the code above  makes the assumption that segment is starting from the
	// top edge of the cell and moving down. The code below chooses the appropriate rotation matrix based on the
	// actual edge the segment started from, and then modifies offset_x and offset_y based on this rotation matrix.
	rotation_matrix := RotationData[s.inEdge]
	offsetX = offsetX*rotation_matrix[0] + offsetY*rotation_matrix[1]
	offsetY = offsetX*rotation_matrix[2] + offsetY*rotation_matrix[3]

	// Finally, we can calculate the segment's position on the screen. See cell2pos function above.
	s.posX, s.posY = CellToPos(s.cx, s.cy, offsetX, offsetY)

	// We now need to decide which image the segment should use as its sprite.
	// Images for segment sprites follow the format 'segABCDE' where A is 0 or 1 depending on whether this is a
	// fast-moving segment, B is 0 or 1 depending on whether we currently have 1 or 2 health, C is whether this
	// is the head segment of a myriapod, D represents the direction we're facing (0 = up, 1 = top right,
	// up to 7 = top left) and E is how far we are through the walking animation (0 to 3)

	// Three variables go into the calculation of the direction. turn_idx tells us if we're making a turn in this
	// cell - and if so, whether we're turning clockwise or anti-clockwise. s.inEdge tells us which side of the
	// grid cell we entered from. And we can use SECONDARY_AXIS_SPEED[phase] to find out whether we should be facing
	// along the primary axis, secondary axis or diagonally between them.
	// (turn_idx - 2) gives 0 if straight, -1 if turning anti-clockwise, 1 if turning clockwise
	// Multiplying this by SECONDARY_AXIS_SPEED[phase] gives 0 if we're not doing a turn in this cell, or if
	// we are going to be turning but have not yet begun to turn. If we are doing a turn in this cell, and we're
	// at a phase where we should be showing a sprite with a new rotation, the result will be -1 or 1 if we're
	// currently in the first (45째) part of a turn, or -2 or 2 if we have turned 90째.
	// The next part of the calculation multiplies in_edge by 2 and then adds the result to the result of the previous
	// part. in_edge will be a number from 0 to 3, representing all possible directions in 90째 increments.
	// It must be multiplied by two because the direction value we're calculating will be a number between 0 and 7,
	// representing all possible directions in 45째 increments.
	// In the sprite filenames, the penultimate number represents the direction the sprite is facing, where a value
	// of zero means it's facing up. But in this code, if, for example, in_edge were zero, this means the segment is
	// coming from the top edge of its cell, and therefore should be facing down. So we add 4 to account for this.
	// After all this, we may have ended up with a number outside the desired range of 0 to 7. So the final step
	// is to MOD by 8.
